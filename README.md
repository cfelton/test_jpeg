Introduction
============
The `test_jpeg` repository is in the middle of a change, originally 
this repository was an example how to use MyHDL to setup a cosimulation 
environment and the jpegenc cores were used (cosim with Verilog) ... 
it is evolving to something more.

During the summer of 2016 two students participated in 
[MyHDL's GSoC](http://dev.myhdl.org/gsoc/gsoc_2016.html).  The 
students worked on implementing the various JPEG Encoder subblocks 
in MyHDL.  The sublocks were broken into frontend and backend. 
Their blogs, [the frontend](https://myhdlgsoc2016.blogspot.gr/) and 
[the backend](https://vikram9866.wordpress.com/), outline their 
work over the summer.  The [latest documentation is available 
on readthedocs](http://jpegenc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The primary goal of this repository is to have a working JPEG 
Encoder implemented in MyHDL.  But not simply implemented in
MyHDL but also utilizing methodologies such as a focus on 
clean and reusable block-to-block interfaces and a full 
regression test suite.

This repository is a development sandbox.  The repository 
contains three related development efforts:

1. A MyHDL implementation of a JPEG-Encoder.
2. Two Verilog reference implementations.
2. MyHDL verification and co-simulation environment, tests will 
   functionally verify and compare the reference JPEG-Encoders. 

The JPEG encoders used are the cores available at open-cores in 
addition to JPEG encoders being developed.  This is a WIP and not 
fully complete (yet).


Quick start guide
=================



Verification Environment
========================
A stimulus and verification environment was created with Python and
MyHDL.  An image is streamed to the encoder and the output is captured.
The hardware generated JPEG bitstream is compared to a software JPEG 
bitstream with similar settings.

In the future the output of the various encoders will be compared to 
each other as well as the encoder performance (.e.g. max fps).


JPEG Encoders
=============

   - hdl/jpegenc_v1: [VHDL JPEG encoder](http://opencores.org/project,mkjpeg) converted to Verilog
   - hdl/jpegenc_v2: [OC Verilog JPEG](http://opencores.org/project,jpegencode) encoder.
   - jpegenc: A fresh (non-ported) MyHDL implementation, `jpegenc` is a Python package
     being developed.

<!-- (@todo: the above need better names?) -->


Getting Started
===============
To run the test the following needs to be installed:

  * Icarus Verilog
  * Python (currently using 2.7)
  * MyHDL
  * Python Imaging Library (e.g. pip install Pillow)


The MyHDL VPI module needs to be built and copied to the test 
directory.

```
>> cd myhdl/cosimulation/icarus
>> make 
>> cp myhdl.vpi <somewhere>/test_jpeg/test
```  

Once the tools and installed and the VPI module built the test can
be run.

```
>> cd test
>> python test_jpecenc.py
```

Depending on the test file the test can take significant time to run.
Majority of the time is spent in the Verilog simulator (as seen from
*top*).  

<!-- 
MyHDL has some inefficiencies with Icarus
([Icarus Cosimulation](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/cosimulation.html#icarus-verilog)).

As mentioned, majority of the time is spent in the Verilog

Results
=======
Someday (probably never) this section might contain some useful information.


Functional
----------
They must work ...


Encoding (compression)
----------------------
awesomely ...


Performance
-----------
and fast ... correct?


Progress Log
==============
 
   **28-Dec-2014** : Conversion error was found in V1, V1 finishes
     compressing the frame.  V2 has error with small images, this 
     might be a design limitation.

   **07-Dec-2014** : Neither encoder completes successfully with a 
     small test image, currently debugging (design1 (v1) conversion 
     complete need to find any errors in conversion).  The test 
     environment will stream the image in and complete shortly after 
     the image has been streamed in.

   **05-Dec-2014** : Design1 conversion to verilog is mostly complete, 
     spending some time verifying.

   **09-Nov-2014** : The test environment will stream an image to both
     the design1 and design2 encoders.  The output is not interrogated
     (yet).  Design1 conversion to verilog is incomplete.


Things to be completed
----------------------

   1. [X] Use Python3 as the default python verson.
   
   1. [ ] Check encoded bitstreams, determine metrics to compare 
          encoders.

   1. [X] Debug the small test image, neither encoder appears to
          finish.

   1. [X] Finish converting desing1 to Verilog.
